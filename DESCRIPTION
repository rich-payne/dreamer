Description: Fits (longitudinal) dose-response models utilizing a Bayesian model
  averaging approach as outlined in Gould (2019) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201700211>
  for both continuous and binary responses.  Functions
  for plotting and calculating various posterior quantities
  (e.g. posterior mean, quantiles, probability of minimum efficacious dose,
  etc.) are also implemented.  Copyright Eli Lilly and Company (2019).
